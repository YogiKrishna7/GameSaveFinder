# GameSaveFinder

GameSaveFinder is a small Java tool that finds where PC games store their save files on Windows.

It scans common locations like:

- AppData  
- Documents  
- My Games  
- Saved Games  

and shows all possible save folders for a game, then lets you open them in File Explorer.

I made this because I kept getting confused about where games save their files, and also for fun.

## How to use

1. Run the program  
2. Enter the game name (example: `schedule`)  
3. Choose the save folder number  
4. The folder opens in File Explorer

## Works with

- Steam games  
- Non-Steam games  
- Unity games  
- Unreal games

## Notes

This is a beginner project.  
It may not find every game, but it works for most.

Thank you 🙂
